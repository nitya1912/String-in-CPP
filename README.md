# Title: 
C++ code to print two character arrays, str1 and str2, to the console.

# Theory:
This C++ code is about printing the contents of two character arrays, `str1` and `str2`, to the console. It displays "SITE&TC" and "Nitya Sharma" on separate lines using the `cout` function from the `iostream` library.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Define two character arrays, str1 and str2, and initialize them with specific text. 2)Use cout to display the content of str1 followed by a line break. 3)Print the content of str2 using cout. 4)The program is complete, and it displays the contents of both character arrays to the console, each on a separate line.

# Explanation of Code:
This C++ code prints the contents of two character arrays, `str1` and `str2`, to the console. It displays "SITE&TC" on one line and "Nitya Sharma" on another line using the `cout` function from the `iostream` library. The code simply outputs the pre-defined text in these arrays to the console.

# Title:
C++ code for counting the number of words in a given input string. 

# Theory:
This C++ code counts the number of words in a given input string. It does so by counting the spaces (whitespace characters) between words. The program prompts the user to input a string, processes it character by character, and counts the spaces to determine the number of words. Finally, it displays the word count.

# Algorithm:
Algorithm includes: 1)Declare a character array str to store the input string and two integer variables, count and i. 2_Prompt the user to enter a string using cout. 3)Read the input string using gets(str). 4)Initialize count to 0. 5)Use a for loop to iterate through the characters of the string. 6)Inside the loop, check each character, and if it's a space (' '), increment the count to count the number of words. 7)After the loop, display the word count by adding 1 to the count variable, as the last word may not be followed by a space. 8)The program is now complete, and it displays the word count.

# Explanation of Code:
This C++ code counts the number of words in a given input string. It reads a string from the user, analyzes it character by character, and increments a counter whenever a space character is encountered, which helps determine the number of words. The program then displays the word count by adding 1 to the counter, as the last word may not be followed by a space.
